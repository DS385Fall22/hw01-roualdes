# Homework 01

Create a Jupyter notebook.  Add at least one markdown cell and at least one code
cell.  In the markdown cell, explain the code that follows.  In the code cell,
show me some new Python code that you have just recently learned, but not within
our class lectures.  If you haven't yet learned any new Python code outside of
our class, do this first.  The code can do anything, make a plot, calculate the
Fibonacci numbers, generate random numbers, or define a simple class.

When you are done, you should use git to push your assignment back into the
repository from which it came.  This way, I can see your work (but no one else can).
